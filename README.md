**Java Journey on Leetcode**

**Aim**: - Improve on how I reason and approach challenges, build algorithms and understanding the dynamics in and inbetween very well
         - Trying solo mentorship with myself 
         - Learning to stop running away from errors in my codes and challenging myself to look beyond errors and blockers positively
         - Test myself as I claim to learn too much but retain not as much
         - Build a better and healthier competitive version of myself
         - Be Better, Be the Best

**Tools**: Leetcode (Of course), Youtube, Gemini and Slack Overflow

**Goal** : *For 2024
       - 30 Problems (scale: easy and medium)
